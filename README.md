# CIS-Apple-Security-Casper

Basic examples of scripts and EA's to implement the CIS Apple Security guidelines for macOS 10.12 only! (some changes between 10.12 and earlier versions).

Not everything in CIS is implemented here. This is partly due to some standards being implemented by profiles and others being out of date and effectively deprecated.
